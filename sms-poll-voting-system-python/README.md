# SMS Poll Voting System

## What Does This Example Do?

Text-to-vote polling system. Create polls, broadcast to contacts, collect votes via SMS, prevent duplicate votes, show real-time results.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building with Telnyx APIs.
- Teams looking for production-ready starting points.
- Anyone exploring what's possible with communications infrastructure + AI.
