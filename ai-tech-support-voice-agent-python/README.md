# AI Tech Support Voice Agent

## What Does This Example Do?

IT helpdesk voice agent with a built-in knowledge base. Callers describe their issue, AI matches against known solutions (password reset, VPN, printer, email, WiFi).

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building with Telnyx APIs.
- Teams looking for production-ready starting points.
- Anyone exploring what's possible with communications infrastructure + AI.

## Why Telnyx?

## Prerequisites
